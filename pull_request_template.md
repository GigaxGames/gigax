<h3>PR Title and Classification</h3>
<p>Only specific types of PRs will be reviewed. The PR title is prefixed appropriately to indicate the type of change. Please use one of the following:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the PR spans more than one category, please include all relevant prefixes.</p>

<h3>Code Quality</h3>

<p>The PR need to meet the following code quality standards:</p>

<ul>
    <li>We adhere to <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html">Google Python style guide</a>.</li>
    <li>The code need to be well-documented to ensure future contributors can easily understand the code.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Notes for Large Changes</h3>
<p>Please keep the changes as concise as possible. For major architectural changes, we would expect a GitHub issue (RFC) discussing the technical design and justification. Otherwise, we will tag it with <code>rfc-required</code> and might not go through the PR.</p>

<h3>What to Expect for the Reviews</h3>

<p>The goal of the gigax team is to be a <i>transparent reviewing machine</i>. We would like to make the review process transparent and efficient and make sure no contributor feel confused or frustrated. However, the gigax team is small, so we need to prioritize some PRs over others. Here is what you can expect from the review process: </p>

<ul>
    <li> After the PR is submitted, the PR will be assigned to a reviewer. Every reviewer will pick up the PRs based on their expertise and availability.</li>
    <li> After the PR is assigned, the reviewer will provide status update every 2-3 days. If the PR is not reviewed within 7 days, please feel free to ping the reviewer or the gigax team.</li>
    <li> Please respond to all comments within a reasonable time frame. If a comment isn't clear or you disagree with a suggestion, feel free to ask for clarification or discuss the suggestion.
 </li>
</ul>
